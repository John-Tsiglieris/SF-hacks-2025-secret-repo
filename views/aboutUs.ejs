                        In the face of natural disasters, information is often scattered and overwhelming. We know this
                        firsthand. After experiencing a natural disaster ourselves, every second matters—but those seconds 
                        are often lost sifting through scattered information sources. We've felt that firsthand, and we saw 
                        the urgent need for a tool that brings everything together when clarity is most needed.

                        Our platform acts like a SIEM—but for disaster response. It consolidates live alerts, regional 
                        susceptibility data, weather forecasts, and historical disaster trends into one single, intuitive 
                        dashboard. Our information comes from verified government agencies, real-time user reports, and 
                        data pulled through the Gemini API, giving users the context and alerts they need—fast.

                        This product isn't limited to one type of event. It's disaster-agnostic, designed to adapt to the 
                        wildfires of the West Coast, hurricanes along the Gulf, tornadoes in the Midwest, and more. Whether 
                        you're preparing, responding, or trying to reconnect with loved ones, our platform is built to save 
                        time when time is most critical.

                        Built at SF Hacks 2025 under the "Tech for Good" theme, our mission is simple: provide a clear,
